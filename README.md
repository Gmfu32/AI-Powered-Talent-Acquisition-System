# AI-Powered-Talent-Acquisition-System

# Introduction:
The AI Talent Acquisition System is a web-based prototype designed to use artificial intelligence to rethink and speed up the hiring process. In order to address one of the most common challenges in human resources, that is, effectively selecting the top applicants from a sizable pool, the system was developed as part of the Hack Attack 2.0 hackathon.
Traditional hiring practices are frequently time-consuming, manual, and subject to bias. Many resumes may be irrelevant, duplicates, or even AI generated, and hiring managers often spend endless hours sorting through them. This inefficiency can cause top talent to be overlooked in addition to delaying hiring decisions.


# Problem Statement:
Any organization must have a talent acquisition strategy that aims to find and hire people who will make a meaningful contribution to the success of the business in addition to filling open positions. It's getting harder to find the right person with the right skill set as industries change and job roles become more specialized (Baker, 2020).


# Aim:
To design and develop an AI-powered Talent Acquisition System that streamlines the recruitment process by intelligently analyzing resumes and job descriptions to identify the most suitable candidates efficiently and fairly.

Objectives:
1.	Automating Resume Screening by building a system that can parse and analyze resumes using AI techniques to extract key skills, experiences, and qualifications.
2.	Implementing AI Matching by developing a semantic matching algorithm using BERT NLP model to score candidate relevance against job descriptions.
3.	Reducing Application Spam Impact by integrating mechanisms to detect and deprioritize spam or AI-generated applications that do not genuinely meet job criteria.
